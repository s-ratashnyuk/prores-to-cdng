Very simple solution to convert Apple Proes RAW files to Cinema DNG.

Works only on Macs because it uses the internal Prores Apple codec.

The main use case is to edit footage from NINJA (or similar) recorders in Davinci Resolve.

For now, it supports only a Panasonic S5m2 (because I own this camera), but it could be easily extended for other cameras.
